:: multi-window ::

[x] define the public interface API

[x] decide if things should take capID or ser
  -- especially the APIs on the externalInterface

[x] change invoke interface to not expect JQuery opts and match docs
[x] remove revoke from the Capability interface (only have it on CapServer)

[x] refactor decode & m[1] into a getCapID function
[x] delete externalInterface
[x] change impls' interface to not expect JQuery opts and match docs

[] resolvers take a ser not an instanceID
[] resolve our naming of resolver --- is it a router?  a gizmatchki?
[] fix interface of instanceResolver to return a public interface and take a ser

[] refactor how Capability objects are constructed so they are "local"
   [] grant needs to not create a Cap object, but just return a ser.
   [] restore -> enliven(?) a function a modules uses on its own capserver to create
      a useful object interface to the cap (from a ser.)
   [] Capability.invoke does the routing up and over to the public interface each time
   [] revive becomes a function called on invocation if needed
   [] fix deadCap (see bork'd FIXME)

[] message port transport tunnel
  [] implement public interface (with common API)
  [] serializes the request to postMessage
  [] remote handler that deserializes and calls local CapServer public interface

[] belay station demo fixes
  [] calls to invoke

[] ui call to allow spawn into new window
  [] user click causes new window, with handler
  [] "open" message provides serializtion info, and capServer snapshot
    [] creates channels, remote handler, capServer
    [] foop's instnace into existance

[] partition instance state in database
  [] so capServer and instance data can save from remote window w/o protocol
  
[] where to put publicInterface tests

:: later ::

[] rework application model
  [] to support enlivening persistent caps
  [] to support "put away"

[] support "put away"
  [] drawer/tab with put away things

[] add name to emote of its target
[] title bar and title on stuff
[] separate tool bar icons
[] top on click if not top

[] belay logout
[] rename belay station to ???
  -- Belay Station is name of service provider

[] layout must work at multiple browser resizes

[] what is with the reload bug where things are in the wrong spot???


[] write a "start servers" script that launches these correctly

[] support tabbed things
  [] os.ui.windowOptions API

[] fix the ugly sticky notes

[] Better station state
  [] store record per instance and tool, not as one big blob
  [] only update record per instance as needed
  [] delay updates and coallesce into one write
  [] update pending indicator (?)
  [] error on unable to update

[] inner desk area should be sized to contain stuff, and scroll if needed
  -- works but h & v scroll bars are funky

[] should provide a utility function for the normal, load up and initialize()
    that each application has to do

[] resolve which div is responsible for w/h 100%, pos abs, t/l 0
    - the generated (by foop) inner div?
    - a static inner div (between belay-container and the foop)
    - the thing's own top div
    - something should overflow:hidden here

[] fix casing in py and js files to be correct

[] progress indicator during foop()
[] read template files as UTF-8 and pass unicode objects to django's templates
[] why does failing foop kill chrome?
[] add |escapejs for stationURL in belay's index.tmpl

[] belay account management page
  [] should show name of provider, not url
  [] should allow deleting the account
  -- never delete, always just archive (!)
  
[] station delete should move to trash

[] generation of JSON in python on launch should be safer
[] server_url shouldn't come from HTTP_HOST? or be sanitized

[] a concept of precious: sometimes you've generated an instance, but until
  it is semantically filled-in, there is no point in saving it.

[] change os.ui.capDraggable() and os.ui.capDroppable to take not just a single
  resourceClass string, but instead an array of descriptors

[] if we detect that the environment isn't secureable (say no Object.freeze)
  [] then we should give a visual indication

[] should have a way for a container to be notified about a change in
  a containee's capServer

[] CapServer.prototype.restore should return null on error, not a deadCap
  - or we should be able to test for a deadCap --- better UI if the
  restoring app can tell if the cap is dead.

[] ? cap restoration before the instance resolver can find the instance


ISSUES
======
[] absolute URLs in components
    -- all have to know their base URL, and it is copied everywhere
[] lack of composability in web client-side framework a real problem
[] should extra property of foop instead be a hook for modifying the os
  before being used? It is concievable that foop may build an os with things
  that are extensible, call the hook, then add things to os that aren't
  overridable
[] resize & window os.ui caps should be much more sophisticated
  - perhaps allowing item to provide a w,h filter function?
[] if we indirect URLs we give out (to users or apps) so that we can revoke,
  then we have the issue of what to do with the caps derived from the cap that
  are delivered to the app:
    1? we box 'em too: the membrane model, requiring knowledge of what is and
        isn't a cap, and the expense of proxying 'em all if not done at the dest
    2? have derived caps be short lived (the SL model) - requires app to do the
        right thing
    3? do nothing -- assume that encapsulation of those caps in the code will
        keep them safe - or at least safe from accidental disclosure
[] letting apps know their instances were killed... or not...
[] dragging: rife with vulnerabilities and ugliness
  - the source supplies the element that is cloned
  - getting the style of the dragged thing out is a pain (scoped css)
[] bringing base libraries into scope is a giant pain in the arse
  - consider getting caps.js in scope - it was easiest to do it in belay/belay
[] should be freezing things in kickoff.js/foop()
[] whole thing is incredibly fragile: 
  - one dead script and the whole page comes to a screaming halt
[] we still rely on being able to walk the DOM tree from container to containee
  - for example during drang-n-drop hilighting
  - this environment therefore, exposes itself - since the containee nodes are
    under the control of the continee


USER STORIES
============
:: pre-demo ::

[] Logger example
      [] creates instance, but registered as a feed & added to tools
  [] mood posting app: "Emote"
    [] only the feed gets to add 'via'

[] App Store Experience
  [] there is a tool that is the app store
  [] clicking on it opens it (not generate)
  [] clicking on an item installs it

:: maybe demo ::

[] Sharing Experience
  [] click on an item and select share
  [] can share to "anyone with the URL"
   -- shares a boxed URL (how do we, or do we box the child cap URLs?)
  [] can share to someone with an e-mail / pet-name
    -- generates an invitiation cap
    -- cap sent/delivered to user
    -- user exchanges it for a cap that is bound to them

:: later ::

[] drag tool to stuff, foop()

[] Several kinds of App
  [x] common iurl for all instances, data stores all state :: hello
  [x] custom iurl for each instance, no data :: station, sticky
  [] custom tool url per station, but common iurl, and storing in data
  [] code installed as tool, data stores all state

[] App Access Experience
  [] drag thing to tool, foop(thing)
  [] drag thing to thing --> grant(thing)
  [] thing has boxed URL for the final thing... (yes?)

[] an instance can offer to add a tool
[] an instnace can offer to add another instance

[] privacy demo -- sharing with someone, sealed to their container


EXPLORATIONS
============

WHAT IS STORAGE
---------------
If A foop's B, then A needs to store enough information to be able to recreate
B in the same state.

    A: Original script & data as provided by B
    B: Original URL & data as provided by B
    C: URL as provided by B
    D: URL & data provided by B
    E: Script & data provided by B

At some point, B will have additional caps, given it by the user or system.
Those need to be pickled too.

    A: Have B tell which caps it needs
    B: Save and restore all additional caps

We need to support both the "instance of an application" model, as well as the
"reference to a remote resource" model.

A "Tool" can be:
  T1: Code that is run on stored instance data
  T2: A URL to code that is run on stored instance data
  T3: A URL that is invoked to get an instance URL

The way we reach the code to be executed for an instance is:
  T1 item -> T1 code
  T2 item -> T2 url -> T2 code
  T3 item -> T3 url -> T3 inst. url -> T3 code

An "Instance" is then some stored element along those paths, and some optional
data. To run (foop) the instance means to follow from the stored thing to get
the code, then start the code with the optional stored data.
  
  Storing things on the left lead to updating, storing things on the right
  lead to more guarantees. 
  
Typically, we store one link before the code:
  T1: store ref
  T2: store url
  T3: store iurl

For now we are following T3, and storing the iurl. Application can return
a constant URL for the inst. url, thus simulating a T2 style tool.



MECHANISMS FOR FOOP
-------------------
a) create a containing div
   XHR from URL to get script
   eval script in confined way
        prepend "use strict"
        var g = undefined; for all globals g
        let "os" into the environment
   -- this implied that you have to add "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"

MISC
----
We need an application/instance life cycle system

  instance :: {
    iurl :: url,
    type :: urn
    data :: string -- JSON
    
    name :: string,
    icon :: data? url?,
    
    location :: Desk | Tools | Accounts | Archive | Misc
    window :: {...} -- as needed
  }
  
  type implies API for starting it:
  
  type == 'instance':
    recreate window environment
    use iurl to fetch JS
    run the js in an env. w/os & os.topDiv 
  
  type == 'generator'
    use iurl to fetch a new iurl
    build an instance on the Desk w/that iurl, type 'instance'
    start that instance
  
  type == ''


Tools area: displays frozen instances, clicking revives in desktop
  ? in area previously opened?
  ? in area requested by code after opening?
  ? in area requested by code when tool was made?
  ? is this a running instance of a "Tool Holder"?
    ? therefore clicking on a instance (or what ever UI it wants)
      allows the instance to request foop'ing another instance
        ? who says iurl/name/icon/type/location?
        
Desk area: displays live instances


Let's look at the usage scenarios we need:

      1) In tool bar is a icon for the App store
a::      Clicking on that tool opens a tab (desk?) window
i::      Clicking on an item in the App store window (presumably user decision)
           installs a new tool in the tool bar

      2) In tool bar is a pad of sticky notes
b::      Clicking on the tool creates a new sticky note on the desk
f,a::    The note can be put away (filed), and reopened
d::      The note can be deleted

      3) While browsing a page  (in a tab?), is a link to create an account
         Clicking create (presumably user decision)
i::        installs a new item in the Accounts tab
f::          - acts like a filed (put away) instance
a::        clicking THAT new item, results in a new tab (desk?) window

a:: - click on an icon launches THAT instance
b:: - click on an icon launches a new instance
d:: - a running (frozen?) item can be deleted
f:: - a running item can be frozen and filed
i:: - running instance can install an item
      (sometimes the item is a tool that does b::, sometimes an instance that does a::)
      (sometimes the item is generic, sometimes it is a generated instance)


SO - big question
  is b:: really a:: followed by i:: followed by a:: on that item --- all without
    a window for the original item??!?!?!?!
    


os.install(<instance_spec>)
os.launch(<instance_spec>)

  iurl :: url,  // where is the code
  type :: Instance | Generator
  data :: string -- JSON
  
  name :: string,
  icon :: data? url?,
